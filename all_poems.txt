Afternoons were me playing football in our compound Getting yelled at by our neighbors for causing a ruckus Afternoons were me pestering my father to take me with him A part of me even hoped he would take me to school with him Just to see how he teaches Afternoons were me hoping a guest would come by Just to get sent to the shop to buy stuff Afternoons were me basically hoping to get out of the house Any reason for me was enough Afternoons were me being sad when it looked like it would rain Cold, grey and gloomy all over I could not play in the mud if it rained At least that was what I was worried about, Not getting wet, or catching a cold, or falling sick... No, all I wanted was to play Afternoons were me watching replays of reality tv shows Or sitting through some boring news shows To watch my evening cartoons Afternoons were me hoping the bus would be a few minutes early So that I could still get Ed, Edd, and Eddy on Cartoon Network   Evenings were me doing my homework Evenings were me learning how to cook Evenings were also me not being allowed in the kitchen For my tendency to drop cutlery Evenings were me running to hug my dad when he arrived from work Evenings were me getting scolded for playing too much, Or dropping in class, or just some other reason there Evenings were me watching telenovelas with my family while eating dinner Even though all their plots followed a similar trope, we still enjoyed them Evenings were me hoping the late-night movie would be awesome And fanboying over comical Jackie Chan action scenes   Nights were me playing video games with my dad Well, mostly me watching him play… Nights were me falling asleep on the couch And finding myself in my bed the next day Nights were me falling asleep in my father’s arms when I was sick Nights were me having to take meds that I hated before I slept, Nights were me having dreams with monsters that I could not fight But somehow my dad was able to. Nights were me sleeping next to my grandmother feeling just right. ﻿We never had much in common Right from the get-go  You loved to walk on the wild side Daring to swim against the tide Happy to go where the wind took you Ready for any adventure. I, on the other hand, Loved to take things slow         Rather than swim in the deepest end I loved to sit by the pool Dipping my legs instead. You loved being thrilled I loved being chilled. It pretty much remained that way. Yet somehow there was one thing  That both of us were; Dreamers. We dreamed of many things; Going to the rainbow, Escaping on some unicorn, Or owning a beautiful wood cabin by a lake Watching sunsets in each other’s arms. We dreamt of love, Of a future,  Of forever. We still dream The hallmark of everything we say and do. And even now, as it was then, These dreams are beautiful, They always will be, Just like you. ﻿Expression   I want to write words so deep Even the soles of my feet will feel them. The day I do that though, it will be such a feat to me. For a long time now,  I have always wanted to spill my emotions on a piece of paper, Sit before an audience Hoping they will appreciate every word of my spilled art. However when I sit down to pen my thoughts,  The words vanish, my mind goes blank And am left staring into space, or outside the window, or at the ceiling. I beat myself so hard, My high spirits fall from their peak Hit the hard cold floor of despair and become shattered like glass All that is left are now just little shards. The fountain of my self-esteem runs dry And whenever I try to open that tap, No confidence drips out to fill my cup. I stare at the paper and ask myself why, why I cannot write Why I cannot express myself. Why I cannot just pour my heart out  So that everyone can see the beauty inside my soul I understand that am just new to this, I have never done poetry before But does it have to be this hard? What I have come to learn though Whenever am starting something, it is never easy I feel like giving up on the way. My strength is sapped, my hope is drained My expectations crushed like that naughty bug But however dim it may seem, Am sure the light at the end of the tunnel shines I will continue my journey, I will still hold my pen Fill my pages with ink of self-expression Maybe one day, the soles of my feet will tell me, “Man, I felt that!” ﻿Hearts broken, Hopes shattered, Dreams crushed, When everything we live for, Gets taken away from us, When all the light fades, And we sink deep Into the haziness of oblivion, Not knowing what the future holds, Clinging so tightly on to a murky past, In this sea of despair, being tossed about by waves of regret And you just wanna let go, But the moment we are so close To drowning in the sea of defeat; That’s when we know  The value of air How much our lungs love to breathe How much we value that gasp we take for granted We put up a valiant effort, Swim against the tides, Just to reach the surface, And breathe once more, Get a glimpse of the sun, Feel the breeze of hope blowing gently across our face. Experience the beauty of not being afraid To lose ourselves in the world of dreams, That’s when we also learn Even broken hearts can love, Like they have never felt the pain, I hope Mine is worth loving. ﻿When I held you in my arms for the first time, You were deep asleep.  Your eyes were closed and you could not even see my face. You were busy seeing your future, Immersed into the ocean of dreams, Swimming against the tide of time, To reach the shore of your destiny. When I held you the second time, Your eyes were open.  You were awake and you had the chance to study this person Whose arms you fit in perfectly. You cried because you did not know me And mummy had to take you away. But I told myself you were probably hungry The next time I held you, You cried again, and you had just come from taking milk. My theory was wrong and I guess you needed time to know me more. I was persistent as never before and I kept on coming, Holding you every single time And before you knew it, you and I were good friends. We shared a bond tighter than any chord. My lap is where you would sit And we would make stories and laugh all day long. It was us, nothing could ever go wrong.   But I had to leave and go back to school. I could only come back home a month or two. This was the trend for the next two years. When I was finally through with high school, You were all grown up, walking and playing all around. You had become so proud and confident The halo above your head gleamed like the sun. You were struggling with your first words And I was struggling with you getting to know me For we had become strangers. I gave you my hand and you refused to shake it. You no longer sat at my lap. My arms were no longer home to you, You preferred daddy or mummy, Never Ian. Well…rarely Ian. For at times, you could come and sit with me, Play with me and make me laugh And then leave, leaving me so thrilled and excited, Happy for that moment that passed. You eventually got to know me once more, Though you still held back. Up to now, you still hold back   But at least you know me and even call my name. Even though at times you refuse to shake my hand, Even though you rarely sit on my lap, Right now it’s only daddy or mummy for you, And that’s how it will always be, Family will always come first for you. My arms will always be open to you, In them you will always find a home, I will make you warm, When this world gets to you, you will find refuge there. When you shed tears, These fingers you used to play with will wipe them away. When a guy breaks your heart, This palm of mine will clench into a fist and break his jaw.   For you are a lily, A beautiful flower. For you are my sister, Lily. Whom I’ll always love. ﻿MANGO   How do you love a mango And hate mango juice? I mean, it is weird, It is crazy and so out of this world. Have you ever heard of someone else  That loves mango and hates mango juice? I know I have never, Guess that’s what makes you unique, huh. Come to think of it, How did you even end up in my life? Maybe, am just a mango tree you chose To blossom in the sunlight of your love My leaves fall at the sound of your voice, My branches shake at your gentle touch,  And despite the strongest winds that shake us, My roots are ever strong in the depth of your heart.   But still, How do you love a mango and hate its juice? How? It’s so uniquely intriguing. I guess the only way to find out is to become your mango For you to hold me in your warm hands And feel my smooth texture, my curves You to take delight in my green color And while I ripen, Observe me turn slowly to a beautiful mixture of yellow and red. For you to slowly peel my skin off; Gently, as gentle as your soul; And eat off the ripened flesh of my love With every bite you take, you feel my affection for you And I can’t be perfect, don’t hate my imperfections, Don’t judge me, Just let them drip away, let the mango juice drip away And when you are finally through, Take me and plant my seed in the garden of your heart. Water it daily with your endless fountains of love. And watch me grow into a lovely big tree, Full of lovely mango fruits, Just for you. ﻿When I would hold his hand,  I felt like I was holding the strongest hand The roughness of his palms told a story Of years of discipline and hard work His palm pressed against mine We would walk hand in hand Till he told me, “Ian you are all grown up now You don’t need me to hold your hand anymore” My soft small palm would fit so well on his I watched as they grew, my palms, Larger and larger by the passing years They could no longer fit in his palms The funny thing is my palms are still soft They have always been People make fun of them, calling them baby hands I like to think they remained that way So that I could always remember what it felt like growing up Whenever I hold his hand ﻿SILENCE   As the old saying goes, Speech is silver but silence is golden. Maybe that’s why we prefer keeping silent on things We should speak out about, Maybe that’s why it is better for us, To chatter our teeth and shiver, Freeze all over, Rather than break the cold ice of silence. Maybe it is because there really is no one to tell, No one who actually cares. Maybe we do want to tell someone, Maybe we once did, twice, even thrice, But they just didn’t care- we grew tired. We cultivated a habit, watered it daily with loneliness and fear, And watched as it grew deep in our souls, Holding things inside of us, Never wanting to share, Never wanting another person to see through us And know what we go through. Times when the sky rains down hails of perils, When the dark grey clouds of despair hang so low in our horizon, When all hope and joy seem to have faded, That time we just need a person to talk to, Maybe just to listen to us and not say a word; We instead keep mum, and bottle it inside ourselves. We do forget though, That every vessel overflows, Ourselves we are no different; we all reach a breaking point. and at that time, we do need someone. Someone to talk to, to listen to our hearts,  To listen to the pain in every heartbeat, And still find appreciate its rhythm, full of harmony. Someone to look at our scars, And still call us beautiful.   But alas… Silence is golden. I don’t know about the rest of you, But I want someone, I want you… I want you to just sit next to me, Hold me quietly, Tell me everything will soon be okay, Not by your words, but by your warm embrace. And in the silence, The two of us will have, A conversation like no other. ﻿You sent me with a message To the girl who searches for Tarzan in the jungle You told me to tell her She needs to get out of her mind And find a real Tarzan maybe. That she needs to stop building castles in the air Or she’ll get hurt. Does she though? Maybe her heart is not strong enough Not as firm a foundation as she believes If she were to build a castle there, It would sink and collapse And her heart, as strong as she thought it was, Would end up broken. Maybe she is not ready to build a real castle Maybe her hand is not yet ready to be held by another To feel the love and warmth of being held Maybe she is not ready for someone to look into her eyes Gaze directly into her soul And see all the fear inside her. She is afraid of getting hurt But dear, you have to tell her Pain is normal, it can’t be avoided. It is a part of growth The scars she gets will be testaments of her strength Her true beauty lies in them They will remind her of where she has come from What she has been through,  And what she can achieve So I will tell her what you sent me to But I also have a message for her Maybe she is not ready to get out of her mind For that is where she has full control. In her mind, she is able to dream In her dreams, she is strong enough to build And no, she doesn’t build in the air, Some wind may sweep her castle away She builds on the stars For she knows nothing can shake the stars Because she hopes one day  Under the clear night sky, She will be lying down on the grass,  With her Tarzan lying close by, Her head on his chest, Listening to the sound of her name  In his every heartbeat While holding hands, they will be watching the stars And she will tell him,  “Honey, you see those stars? That’s where I built our castle.” ﻿It’s a clear sky, We walk hand in hand, The smile on your face, Outmatched only by the radiance of the sun. You tell me you don’t know which instrument to learn, I propose you should try the guitar, Turns out, You don’t want to hurt your fingers. Piano is boring for you, Drums are all too common. “Then just sing,” I tell you. “I wanna learn an instrument.” You were ever the complicated one. Clouds begin to creep on our sky.   You are now talking about your favorite music, How you love Celine Dion, How you wish to sing like Mariah Carey, Or Whitney Houston. Or how you call me perfect, because I remind you Of your favorite song. And I tell you how you are my favorite music, How I wish I could listen to your heartbeat all day, How I wish I could record it and carry it around in my phone So that every time I miss you, I just wear my earphones Listen to your heart. At this time, you look me straight in the eye, And promise to be with me through the bad and good; To be the music that brings me to my feet, When everything else weighs me down. The clouds get darker and darker, The sun out of sight. The wind gets fiercer. A storm is brewing, I could feel it.   We haven’t talked in two weeks, the last kiss we had was not right, you keep standing me up, you don’t text me back, we fight every time, you kissed some other guy.   I am barely holding on, to this sinking ship, this ship you are wrecking, When you deliver the last blow, And tell me you don’t even know if you love me, that maybe I don’t deserve you and that you are sorry our worlds had to meet, I let go.   It’s now raining, Damn it’s cold, And the only thing am wearing are these scars you left me with, I bleed and I cry, There is this empty space inside me, a void, That longs for you, I long for you. I long for music, And in my mind, I hear this melancholy tune, Full of verses of your broken promises, And a chorus of your perfidy.   Someone once told me, “Things always work out in the end.” It does stop raining, The sun does come out once more,   “Hey. My name is Ian. I really think you are fun and cute.” “Hey Ian. I kinda like you too.” ﻿What(Pause, rise) happened to you?(Pause) You promised you'd never make me cry, That every tear that comes down my cheek Sets the depths of your soul ablaze; That you could never bear to see me weak.(Pause) What happened?(Falling)  You always told me am strong In ways more than one, You kept on reminding me of where we have come from, Whenever I just felt like giving up and being done,(Small pause) You were my hero, my favorite superhero, and I was the only one that knew your secret identity. That knew how you donned your superhero costume, That knew your favorite cape That knew how you flew in the skies Flew straight to me, where I was And saved me at my weakest. What(pause, low) happened?  Your cape now lies in the closet of broken promises, Your costume dirty and forgotten, (Rise) You want to give up on that life, Being a hero is too much, you say Who saves the hero, you ask? Without thinking about me, without caring how it affects the people around you, The people who love you,(fall) the people you love. Who is going to save me now? Who will help me pick up these pieces of my broken heart, Scattered all over the ice cold floor of despair? Who will save me from these storms of depression? From drowning in this sea of self-pity and regret?  Or maybe am just being too selfish, Maybe you also need a hero, wish That someone can also save you. I know am no hero, am nothing like you, Am just the damsel in distress, But I know there is no greater feeling Than when you take me under your wing, And save me, and we fly off in your arms,  Together, we are this unstoppable force, We are a fairy tale come true, We are a love story with a happy ending.  So no. Darling, know this, When you save me, you also save yourself If you give up on yourself, If I give up on you, What's to become of me? I'll be selfish till the end I’ll force you to wear your costume, your cape, Dont just save me, save others as well. Let their smiles and joy echo in your soul Let my smile(extended, pause) echo in your soul Let my happy face be one of your dearest memories. Hold on to it as tightly as I hold on to you.   (Pause) Because am sure,(Pause) You don’t want to see me like last time, The last time I cried, Because of you.  ©mystifier ﻿Young boy, when will you learn that this world does not care for you? When will you learn that the world is too complex For your little brain to comprehend?   When will you learn That this world is too large For your little arms to carry?   When will you learn? When will you learn that your eyes are too small For you to see beyond the horizon?   When will you learn that you can only walk so far On those legs of yours before you trip and fall even futher On the unforgiving ground of this hard world?   When will you learn, That perfection is not only when there is nothing else to add But can also be when there is nothing else left to take away? And I watch you every single day, Taking bits of your life away from yourself Trying so hard to understand and bear the burdens of this world Maybe even carry some Maybe even lighten it for others, make them less worrisome You so badly want to be that hero, everyone’s friend Yet you can’t even realize that You won’t even be able to save yourself in the end.   You walk around with a heavy heart Always afraid of the hurt, the next day might bring Your mind is always clouded, worrying about the next thing you have to do Hiding behind poetry and fancy metaphors, a perfect cover for you Never speaking directly, Never let people know how you feel Just expecting them to figure it out if or when they will, The same way you think that they help you make sense of this world It has always been mad Why can’t you just drop this farce?   You try so hard to do everything But you don’t have to do it all  You only get a single shot at this one. And I know it sucks because you have to learn on the job But maybe instead of trying to carry this world alone Let’s try doing it together.
