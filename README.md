# Matplotlib-Animation---WordClouds

This is just a fun, personal project that was intended to help me learn the Matplotlib Animation package. I wanted to find out which are the most frequent words that I have used in my 4 years of writing poetry. I also wanted a visual representation of this so I resorted to the Wordcloud package. Figuring out how to combine the two packages was the difficult part of the project. 

Commented source code is provided in *wordcloud_anim.py* and the resulting animation file is called *all_poems wordcloud animation.mp4*.
